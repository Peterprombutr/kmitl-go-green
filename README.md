# kmitl-go-green
tl;dr mini plant monitoring and watering system project (as hinted in the naming, this was designed for Marijuana but since that was illegal in Thailand back then, bird's eye chili pot acted as our stand-in plant) that's controlable via a Twitter Bot's DM.

"semi-maintained" version of https://github.com/Peterprombutr/kmitl-go-green (not really lol, the associated AWS instance is long gone and related Twitter API has since been deprecated)
